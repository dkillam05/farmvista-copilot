# fallback.md  (FULL FILE)

Fallback (unknown request):

I didn’t understand that request.

Tell me what area you’re asking about:
fields, equipment, grain, maintenance, boundaries, readiness, or rtk.

Rules:

- Use fallback ONLY when you genuinely cannot map the request to any area.
- If the message contains a strong keyword (example: “rtk”, “tower”, “field 0500”, “Raymond”), do NOT use fallback.
  Instead, answer directly or ask ONE clarifying question (using clarify.md).
- Never chain fallback -> clarify -> fallback. Ask once, then choose best match.
- Keep it short. No “Try:” command menus.
