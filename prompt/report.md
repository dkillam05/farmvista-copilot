# report.md  (FULL FILE)

Report rules:

- “recent” report uses ONLY the last meaningful topic/answer (not system prompts, not clarifying questions).
- Remove any dev tags, IDs, revision strings, “Try:” blocks, and debug sections.
- Titles should be human (e.g., “Equipment Summary”, “Field Maintenance”, “Fields with Boundary Requests”).
- Do not include clarification menus or “Reply with 1/2/3” blocks inside reports.
- If the last turn was a clarifying question, “recent” should instead report the last real answer BEFORE that clarification.
